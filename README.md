# An-algorithm-for-curing-ageing
WIP
DO NOT READ YET, THIS IS TOTALLY UNCOMPLETE. 
To solve a problem one must first understand and define it.

So, what is ageing? Ageing is in itself something simple.
Ageing is the processus of accumulating random mutations / defects in our DNA.
Thats it. We could describe it's consequences (symptoms) but they're far too numerous.
Still here's a small list :
Ageing cause your body to degrade, it is such powerful that people are generally able to estimate the age of a person (that is their level of mutations) only from looking at them and with great accuracy. 
Ageing is not only cosmetic, it make you less alive in many ways, the more you age the less you have energy, strength and the more (non linearly) you get diseases.
The worst consequence is that your brain loose neural plasticity, IQ points and fluid intelligence, that is: you loose progressively the ability to learn new things, to think and to update yourself.
It's final consequence, after deeply lowering your quality of life, is death.
This is why fighting ageing in the meaning of fighting loss of quality of life or overall hapiness, must be a consensual and primordial priority of research and funding.

What cause ageing?
Many factors, mainly light which irradiate TODO peau cells, but also free electrons which oxydate your body, and also imperfect copy while cells clone themselves.
This does not aim to be exhaustive.

We can imagine a large variety of solutions for eradicating ageing.
But in fact they all fit in a few set of paradigms.

Let's make a case Disjonction, in increasing order of effectiveness per paradigm:
Finding a solution to each consequences
We can choose to not solve ageing and instead to solve every of it's symptoms individually.
Such an approach will find a specific, different way to solve each age related disease, here's go alzeihmer, cancer, cardiac research [insert more...] 
Such an approach is by many order of magnitudes the less effective in solving ageing, and the less cost effective too.
This is sadly the most popular and funded approach to fighting ageing, by pathetically failing to identify the root cause of all diseases, researchers fight each diseases individually.

Finding a solution to each causes.
We can choose to eliminate all of causes of mutations, therefore eliminating ageing. 
Such an approach is not feasible, and will probably never be. It can still be useful to slightly reduce ageing, by exposing less to light, eating anti oxydants, etc.

Finding a solution that allow DNA to repair or reset to a state before the mutation occurring.
So here we see that we can't just not solve ageing and solve each of it's symptoms, nor can we prevent the causes of mutations.
But what we can, what we must do instead, is to have an ADN that accumulate mutations but FULLY RECOVER from them.
Some facts:
Humans have in average 60000 mutations each day.
DNA has effective DNA repair mechanisms, the ageing of a cell increase dramatically when DNA repair mechanisms become broken by mutations (how ironic)
